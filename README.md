# Web-Design-Challenge

This repository contains a basic website dashboard with multiple pages to present weather data analysis based on weather data taken from cities around the world. Various plots are presented featuring the different weather data.

The pages are functional and can be [accessed HERE](https://lmfao415.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/).

There are 7 pages total, including:

* A **landing page** containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. Featuring a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, where clicking an image takes the user to that visualization.
  
* Four **visualization pages**, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A **"Comparisons" page** that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
    * The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
* A **"Data" page** that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    * The data comes from the [cities.csv](https://github.com/lmfao415/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/main/Resources/cities.csv) file . 

The website also features a navigation bar at the top of each page.
